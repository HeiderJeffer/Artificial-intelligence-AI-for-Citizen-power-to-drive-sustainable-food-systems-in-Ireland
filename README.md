# Purpose and aims


- Overall, the scientific significance and novelty of the project
  > respond to Irish national, European, and international incentives
  > for ethical drive sustainable food systems and involve more humane
  > from all backgrounds to be engage in our project development in to
  > Irish national, European, and international levels.

- Ongoing partnership, producing original research, training/teaching
  > students, and other highly qualified personnel.

- Generating a virtuous circle party in academia with: History Science,
  > Archival Science, Digital Humanities, Computer Science, Media
  > Technology, Food Sciences, Nutrition, Public Health, Consumer
  > Psychology, Human Behaviour, Sustainability, Social Science, Climate
  > Science and Environmental Science.

- Looking for feedback loop: to reinforce and exchange the knowledge
  > capabilities and ideas with generated virtuous circle party in
  > academia.

# Background and Related Work

- Artificial intelligence (AI) for Sustainable food systems refers to a
  range of digital tools and techniques for information processing and
  data mining that are automated.

- The term "food system" refers to the network of interrelated systems
  and activities that affects agriculture, food, nutrition, and
  health(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
  In Brief The State of Food and Agriculture
  [2021](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb7351en)).”

- To coexist on Earth for a very long period, sustainability is a social
  objective (Ramsey, Jeffry L. 2015).

- Healthy food is made available to people through sustainable food
  systems, which also develop resilient social, economic, and
  environmental frameworks for the food industry (Berlin: SAPEA, Science
  Advice for Policy by European Academies.
  [p. 22](https://www.sapea.info/wp-content/uploads/sustainable-food-system-report.pdf),
  2020).

## Finding Study

- Study 1: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit
  transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate
  transformational change and disruption (Camarena, 2022).

- Study 2: Costs of healthy, sustainable diets around the world (Mullen,
  2021).

- Study 3: The cost of zero hunger (Mullen, 2021)

- Study 4: Leverage points for sustainability transformation (Abson,
  2017)

- Study 5: Household food insecurity and children's school engagement
  (Ashiabi 2005)

- Study 6: Programme coordinators' perceptions of strengths, weaknesses,
  opportunities and threats associated with school nutrition programmes
  (Valaitis, 2014)

- Study 7: The role of artificial intelligence in achieving the
  sustainable development goals (Vinuesa, 2020)

  COVID-19 crisis (Worstell, 2020).

# Research objective  
The major research questions will answer in this project are:


- What are the current initiatives to promote AI for sustainable food systems in Ireland?
- What are the current challenges to AI for sustainable food systems in Ireland?
- What are the potential benefits of citizen-led initiatives to promote AI for sustainable food systems in Ireland?
- What are the best practices for citizen-led initiatives to promote AI for sustainable food systems in Ireland?

# Methodology  
## Case study  
Aiming to support both the implementation and the maintenance School Meals Scheme, Department of Social Protection - Republic of Ireland, School Meals Scheme provides funding to schools and organizations towards the provision of healthy food for school children.

Ireland-based software company Anne Heider food Solutions[^1] offers a suite of sustainable food products in Ireland to support School Meals Scheme to manage:  
(1) school nutrition programs.  
(2) food distribution programs.  
(3) administrative reviews.  
(4) food tracking and reporting.

As part of the Anne Heider food Solutions’ offering of a “software as a service” solution and for a monthly licensing fee, School Meals Scheme or Department of Social Protection authorities can access Anne Heider food Solutions program management features through a web page without the need for hardware or software infrastructure.


Anne Heider food Solutions have also developed a new range of software features centered around the provision and reporting of nutrition information for School Meals Scheme. The information can be used by Department of Social Protection to plan then report about each meal under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (Irish and EU legislation on food safety).

It became necessary to launch a software development project to automatically capture nutrition and other meal data because of the offering and reporting of these new capabilities.

In this research we present the Anne Heider food Solutions new software new steps against the existing steps provided by Camarena software \[1\] Plan Menu/ Place Order: Integrated compliance check, \[2\] School sites enter daily notes: Integrated compliance check and \[3\] report to federal / state / local authority (Camarena, 2022).

## Research Approach  
This project is designed to be exploratory due to the nascent nature of Anne Heider food Solutions due the how and why of a recent series of events over which the investigator has little to no influence (Yin, 2014, p. 9).  
  
The research approach three main stages:  
1. Stage 1: understanding the context
2. Stage 2: understanding AI **
3. Stage 3: investigating the opportunities and challenges of AI for citizen power to drive sustainable food systems in Ireland, document analysis, participant observation, and interviews.  
  
**Triangulation and Systems thinking:** The research is qualitative in nature, relying on thematic analysis[^2]. Triangulation—the use of evidence from many sources to support facts and findings—is made possible by gathering data from three different sources (Rowley, 2002; Yin, 2014), the epistemological lens of systems thinking, which is constrained by the researcher's worldviews of what defines sustainable food systems, is used to solve sustainability concerns. (Abson et al.,2017; Dorninger et al., 2020). **  
**  
Against the (Camarena, 2022) research approach, this project offers a new approach:  
**  
Data Collection -** in Stage 1 and Stage 2 used direct input from document analysis, participant observation, and interview, we will apply quality assurance criteria and extracting relevant information.  
**  
Data analysis** – The project used thematic data analysis (NVivo
software) to process the data in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and to ensure
collection. to extract the major context factors from Stage 1 and the
major AI factors from Stage 2, the process resulted in:  
1. Stage 1 (major context factors)
2. Stage 2 (major AI factors)
3. Stage 3 relied on the data analysis of stage 1 (major context factors) and stage 2 (major AI factors).

    involves reading through a set of data and looking for patterns in
    the meaning of the data to find themes.
